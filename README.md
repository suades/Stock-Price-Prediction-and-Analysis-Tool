##Stock Price Prediction and Analysis Tool

This project is a C# application designed to predict stock prices and analyze market trends using machine learning and statistical methods. It leverages ML.NET for implementing Ridge Regression models, enabling accurate predictions of future stock prices. The application also incorporates Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) calculations to provide a comprehensive analysis of historical stock data trends.

Key features:

Real-time Data Fetching: Automatically retrieves the latest stock data using the Alpha Vantage API, ensuring predictions are based on up-to-date market information.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes ML.NET to build and train Ridge Regression models for forecasting future stock prices with improved accuracy.
Data Visualization: Displays stock price trends with interactive charts, allowing users to toggle between SMA and EMA views for deeper insights into market movements.
This tool is ideal for developers, data scientists, and finance enthusiasts looking to explore machine learning applications in stock market analysis.
